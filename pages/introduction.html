                <h2>What is Diabetes?</h2>
                <p>Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder affecting millions worldwide. It occurs when the body cannot regulate blood sugar properly due to insulin issues. According to the <strong>World Health Organization (WHO)</strong>, over <strong>537 million adults</strong> have diabetes, a number expected to rise to <strong>643 million by 2030</strong>. Left untreated, diabetes can lead to severe complications such as <strong>heart disease, kidney failure, nerve damage, and vision loss</strong>.</p>

                <h2>Why Does It Matter?</h2>
                <p>Diabetes is a <strong>global health crisis</strong>, impacting individuals of all ages. Early detection and management can prevent serious complications. Studies show that <strong>over 50% of Type 2 diabetes cases</strong> are preventable through lifestyle modifications. Governments and healthcare organizations are investing in <strong>awareness campaigns, research, and better medical interventions</strong> to mitigate its effects.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h2>Who is Affected?</h2>
                <p>Diabetes does not discriminate; it affects people across all demographics. However, <strong>genetics, lifestyle, and environment</strong> play a significant role in determining an individual's risk. Certain ethnic groups, people with sedentary lifestyles, and those with a family history of diabetes are at higher risk. Additionally, an increasing number of children and young adults are being diagnosed due to rising obesity rates.</p>

                <h2>What Has Been Done So Far?</h2>
                <p>Medical research has led to advancements in diabetes management, including insulin therapy, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), and AI-based predictive analysis. Pharmaceutical companies are developing newer medications, and wearable technology  is improving self-monitoring. However, there is still a long way to go in making these treatments accessible to everyone globally.</p>

                <h2>History & Evolution of Diabetes Treatment</h2>
                <p>Understanding diabetes has evolved over centuries, from early descriptions in ancient Egyptian texts to modern-day advancements in insulin therapy and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). The discovery of insulin in 1921 by Banting and Best marked a revolutionary step in diabetes management, transforming it from a fatal disease to a manageable chronic condition. Today, AI-driven diagnostics and precision medicine are shaping the future of diabetes care, offering tailored treatments based on genetic and lifestyle factors.</p>

                <h2>Economic & Social Impact of Diabetes</h2>
                <p>Diabetes is not just a health issue but also a major economic burden. According to the <strong>International Diabetes Federation (IDF)</strong>, global healthcare expenditures for diabetes reached <strong>$966 billion in 2021</strong>, a <strong>316% increase over the last 15 years</strong>. Beyond financial costs, diabetes affects the quality of life, productivity, and mental health of individuals, reinforcing the need for <strong>early prevention strategies, better healthcare policies, and increased public awareness</strong>.</p>
